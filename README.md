# About the project

Taskolab is a centralized automation platform that empowers support teams to run predefined engineering-approved tasks across distributed infrastructure. 


## Current status of this project
Taskolab is in very.. very.. **early development**.  
However I will share that this project has a **working foundation** that includes:

- Backend FastAPI server with secure JWT authentication
- Dynamic backend mapper system to control agent behavior
- Modular, organized logic template system for operations, menus, and automation scripts
- CLI agent prototype capable of:
  - Authenticating to backend
  - Fetching dynamic instructions from the server
  - Importing and executing dynamic logic templates

## Features
- Lightweight CLI agent for remote execution
- Centralized task definition and control
- Modular design with React-based frontend (To Be implemented)

## Taskolab aims to provide:
- Full backend-driven orchestration of agents
- Modular task templates and automation scripts
- Support for hierarchical menus and branching workflows
- Centralized logic and dictionary management
- Dynamic agent behavior without redeploying agents
- Fine-grained control based on user roles (developer, support, etc.)

## Roadmap Objectives
- Backend Security Enhancements
- Add sub-mapper support for deeper multi-layer menus
- Develop full web-based management dashboard with modern GUI look (React + Tailwind) (tbd)
- Role-based access control for users
- Error handling and audit logging
- Various testing
